                <p>According to the US Forestry Service, studies “...show that being outside in nature is relaxing, reducing our stress, cortisol levels, muscle tension and heart rates – all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.” Just by spending 2 hours outside every day, you can add years to your life span and feel good doing it. Going on walks or runs will also help you get fit, which is a great bonus.

                    Being a part of this movement is not difficult. Just by getting out there every day you can make yourself happier, feel better, and live longer! Take a walk on your time off, bike to school, or even just sit in your backyard; time in nature is time for yourself.
