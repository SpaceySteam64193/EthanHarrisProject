            <p>Modern comforts have rendered the outside world a plain and neglected place. But nature is so much more than a sunny day or a nice stroll. Experiencing nature is necessary for a healthy mind and body.

                <p>On average, people who spend more time outdoors report higher levels of happiness. According to a study gathered by scientific reports, levels of happiness increase exponentially up to about 120 minutes. An article written by Yale University, covering this study, mentions that it had a test group of 20,000 people, and that spending 120 minutes outside each day is the perfect amount of time to reap all the benefits of nature, physically and mentally. After that, reports become more randomly assorted as a matter of circumstance. For example, homelessness can be a large factor in people not being happy outside.</p>
